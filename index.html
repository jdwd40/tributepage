                    <p>Rik Mayall was one of my favourite actor/comediens. I first came across him in the young ones. He went one to be in several cult sitcoms which were favourites of mine, including The New Statesman, Bottom and Blackadder. Below is Wikipedia's summary of him.</p>
            
                    <p>Mayall was a pioneer of alternative comedy in the early 1980s. He formed a comedy partnership with Ade Edmondson, and appeared in numerous cult classic sitcoms, including The Young Ones (1982–84), Filthy Rich & Catflap (1987), "The Comic Strip Presents", The New Statesman (1987–94), Bottom (1991–95), Blackadder, and in the comedy films Drop Dead Fred (1991) and Guest House Paradiso (1999). His acting style was described as energetic "post-punk".[1]
                    In 1998 he suffered a serious head injury in a quad bike accident near his Devon home, from which he subsequently recovered.
                    Rik Mayall died of a suspected heart attack on June 9th 2014. At the time of his death, Mayall was described by Danny Cohen, director of BBC Television, as a "truly brilliant" comedian with a unique stage presence, whose "fireball creativity" and approach to sitcom had inspired a generation of comedy stars. </P>
